# flippant-js

## Please Note:

This fork was made to solve some issues I was having with this plugin, and may not work for you.
Feel free to use it if you want, just know that I won't necessarily address any issues that arise with it.

## Description:
* Flippant has a single function: `flippant.flip()`. Use it to flip things.
* There are two modes: `card` (the default), and `modal`.
* The back gets the default class of `.flippant-modal-dark` for modals and `.flippant-modal-light` for cards. These styles can be overridden or you can pass in your own additional class.
* Most of the magic is in the css file. Override however you'd like

## Example:

    var front = document.getElementById('flipthis');
    var back_content = "<h1>I'm the back!</h1>"; // Generate or pull any HTML you want for the back.
    var back;
    
    // to flip
    back = flippant.flip(front, back_content) // flip(element_to_flip, content_for_back, type(modal/card), extra_class_for_back)
    
    // to close (i.e. to flip back)
    back.close()
